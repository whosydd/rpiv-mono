slug: synthesize
tagline: Merges independent per-slice designs into one coherent phased plan in `.rpiv/artifacts/plans/`, reconciling overlaps and wiring integration seams as the fan-in barrier of the design fanout.
purpose: |
  Each per-slice design was produced *blind to its siblings*, so someone must make them fit: merge colliding edits to the same file, wire each dependency to the real shape its owner defined, and resolve incompatible decisions to one. For large slice maps it runs hierarchically (per-cluster sub-plans, then a root merge), so no single pass must hold every design at once.
when_to_use:
  - Dispatched by the build pipeline after the design review accepts the per-slice designs.
  - Root mode (`--subplans`) when a cluster fanout has produced partial sub-plans to merge.
  - Prefer `plan` when there was no design fanout. This skill reconciles existing decisions; it never designs.
inputs:
  - name: --designs
    required: true
    source: Per-slice design docs under `.rpiv/artifacts/designs/` (repeatable)
    notes: Required in flat and partial modes; each contributes its File Map, Key Interfaces, Integration Points, and Success Criteria.
  - name: --subplans
    required: false
    source: Partial sub-plans from a cluster fanout (repeatable)
    notes: Selects root mode. The root reads each sub-plan's `summary`, `exports`, and phases instead of re-reading every design.
  - name: --research
    required: false
    source: The research artifact the slices rest on
    notes: Supplies cross-slice constraints during reconciliation.
  - name: --as-subplan
    required: false
    source: Flag from the cluster fanout
    notes: Emits a compact sub-plan (partial mode) instead of a full plan.
  - name: --cluster
    required: false
    source: Ordinal supplied by the cluster fanout (partial mode only)
    notes: "Written verbatim into the sub-plan's `_cluster-<k>.md` filename. For a manual partial run, scan `.rpiv/artifacts/subplans/` for existing `*_cluster-<k>.md` and take the next unused positive integer — a missing or duplicated ordinal trips the cluster-coverage floor and a re-dispatched pass would clobber a sibling sub-plan."
outputs:
  - artifact: Phased plan (flat / root mode)
    path: .rpiv/artifacts/plans/
    format: markdown with machine-readable `phases:` + `phase_count` frontmatter and Synthesis Notes
  - artifact: Sub-plan (partial mode)
    path: .rpiv/artifacts/subplans/
    format: same phase shape plus `summary` and `exports` frontmatter naming the seams the root wires
key_steps:
  - title: Read every input fully
    rationale: Reconciliation only works over the complete set. A design skimmed is a collision missed. Hierarchy, not selective reading, is how context stays bounded.
  - title: Reconcile overlap, integration, and conflict
    rationale: This is the whole point of the barrier. Two blind designs touching the same file or symbol must become one coherent change. A dependency must reference the real shape its owner defined, not a guess at it.
  - title: Record every resolution in Synthesis Notes
    rationale: The grade panel's correctness and architecture-fit members check the resolutions, and `elaborate` later reads the notes as the reconciled seams it must not re-decide.
  - title: Sequence one phase per slice, dependency-ordered
    rationale: A phase must never precede one it depends on, or `implement` builds against interfaces that do not exist yet; tightly-coupled slices may merge into one phase, with the merge noted.
  - title: Emit plan-compatible output with machine-readable phases
    rationale: "`phase_count` must equal both the `phases:` array length and the heading count. A downstream derive-check (a program, 0 LLM calls) rejects any mismatch. The standard phase shape lets `implement` and `validate` consume the plan unchanged."
  - title: Decide conflicts yourself, never ask
    rationale: The skill is non-interactive. The design review already collected the human's calls, so an unresolvable conflict gets the most defensible resolution on record. The grade panel catches a bad merge.
