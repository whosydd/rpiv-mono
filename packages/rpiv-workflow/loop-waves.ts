/**
 * loop-waves.ts — topological wave scheduling for dependency-bearing fanout units.
 *
 * A fanout unit may declare `Unit.deps` (the `id ?? label` identities of units it
 * depends on). `computeWaveLevels` assigns each unit a Kahn topological LEVEL over
 * those DIRECTED edges — level 0 = roots (no deps), level k = max(dep levels)+1 —
 * and groups unit INDICES by level. The wave dispatcher (loop-parallel.ts) runs one
 * bounded-parallel dispatch per level, so a dependent never opens before the units it
 * depends on have filled their slots. A deps-free fanout collapses to a single
 * level — byte-identical to the pre-wave flat dispatch.
 *
 * Ordering vs grouping: this is NOT clusterSliceDag (built-ins/slices.ts), which
 * is undirected union-find producing connected-component GROUPS for synth. Waves
 * need DIRECTED levels — different algorithms over the same edge data.
 *
 * Leaf: the identity join key (`unitTagOf`) is the SAME one the resume drift guard
 * and `fanoutUnitAt` read, so deps resolve against the exact ids the slots are keyed
 * by. Validation throws the runner's typed preflight (deps are runtime-computed, so
 * the static load gate can't see them — `stage-rules.ts` never inspects the unit list).

 * level: live dispatch and resume re-wave produce identical waves. A residual
 * (unlevellable) node ⇒ a dependency cycle ⇒ `invariantPreflight`.
 *
 * Dangling deps (an id matching no unit) are SKIPPED here (treated as satisfied) so
 * a single missing id can't masquerade as a cycle; `ensureUnitDeps` is the one that
 * reports dangling refs. At the live entry `ensureUnitDeps` runs first, so a cycle
 * reaching here is post-validation/defensive; the throw still lands a clean halt.
