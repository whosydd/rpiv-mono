/**
 * Host ports — the contract the workflow runtime needs from its host
 * environment, expressed in workflow-domain vocabulary.
 *
 * The package never re-exports `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` types
 * from its public surface. Two host shapes implement these ports:
 *
 *  - The interactive Pi launcher (`ExtensionCommandContext`) — satisfies the
 *    OBSERVER surface (`ui`/`sessionManager`/`hasUI`/`waitForIdle`) and is
 *    retained as a progress observer only; it no longer executes stages.
 *  - The detached executor host (`SdkWorkflowHost`, in rpiv-pi) — satisfies the
 *    FULL surface including `spawnChild`/`maxConcurrency`; it owns the child
 *    `AgentSession` pool every stage runs in.
 *
 *  - `WorkflowHost`        — registry-level host (default-export ctor +
 *                            skill-registration preflight).
 *  - `WorkflowHostContext` — per-command ctx passed into `runWorkflow`; spawns
 *                            child sessions and never swaps itself out.
 *
 * Compile-time tripwire: `host.test.ts` asserts Pi's concrete observer types
 * extend the observer surface; `rpiv-pi`'s `sdk-workflow-host.test.ts` asserts
 * `SdkWorkflowHost` satisfies the full executor port (the satisfaction
 * assertion lives there because rpiv-workflow must not import rpiv-pi).
 */

/**
 * Registry-level host. Default-exported function receives this; the runner
 * uses it for skill-registration preflight (enumerating registered commands).
 *

 * continue-policy host-fallback ladder — every stage now holds a live child

	 * sending `prompt` (the body sends the continuation turn via `sendUserMessage`,
