Turn "build this feature" into a run of named stages — discover → research → design →
plan → implement → validate → code-review → commit — each one writing a reviewable
Markdown artifact under `.rpiv/artifacts/` that the next stage consumes. rpiv-pi adds 29
skills, 15 specialist subagents, and four ready-made `/wf` pipelines to
[Pi Agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono), and runs every stage in a detached child
session you watch from a lane dock below your editor. It is for developers who want
structured, reviewable multi-stage work instead of one very long chat turn.

## Install

```sh
pi install npm:@juicesharp/rpiv-pi
```

Restart your Pi session.

## Quick start

rpiv-pi registers no tools of its own — it drives the ones its sibling extensions
provide. Install them in one step, then restart Pi again:

```
/rpiv-setup
```

The dialog previews every change and applies nothing until you confirm.

You also need a model configured in Pi. If `/login` already works you are set;
otherwise see [docs/models-config.md](./docs/models-config.md).

Now run a pipeline:

```
/wf build "add a --json flag to the export command"
```

`build` is the default — run `/wf "<task>"` and it resolves here. It captures your
brief, slices it, designs each slice in parallel, gates the plan, then implements and
validates; see [docs/workflows.md](./docs/workflows.md) for the full stage list and
the other pipelines. The run detaches immediately: a lane appears in
the dock under your editor with live progress while you keep typing. Press `ctrl+q` —
or `↓` on an empty prompt, or `/lanes` — to step in, replay the transcript, answer a
parked question with `⏎`, or stop the run with `x`.

Prefer one stage at a time? Every skill also stands alone:

```
/skill:research "how does session state survive /reload"
/skill:blueprint .rpiv/artifacts/research/<latest>.md
/skill:implement .rpiv/artifacts/plans/<latest>.md
```

## What you get

- **Reviewable artifacts instead of one long turn** — every skill declares a contract
  (`produces` / `consumes`) and writes timestamped Markdown into
  `.rpiv/artifacts/<bucket>/`, so you can read, edit, or reject a design before a line
  of code is written.
- **Runs that don't hold your session hostage** — each `/wf` stage executes in its own
  detached child session with bounded parallel fan-out; your interactive session stays a
  launcher and an observer.
- **A dock that shows what is happening** — one row per run with live progress,
  streaming thinking, per-unit fan-out sub-rows, token usage, and failure reasons. Step
  in for a faithful transcript replay with full tool rendering.
- **Questions that never get lost** — when a detached stage needs input it parks the
  question on its lane with a badge instead of hijacking your prompt; `⏎` on the flagged
  lane arms it inline.
- **Four pipelines out of the box** — `build`, `vet`, `polish`, and `ship`, so
  you never have to author a workflow to get value.
- **Cheap models for cheap stages** — `/rpiv-models` sets model and reasoning-effort
  overrides per skill, per stage, per workflow, or per subagent, with a typo-catcher for
  keys that would otherwise silently never apply.
- **Your architecture docs, injected where they matter** — touch a file and the nearest
  `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `.rpiv/guidance/<sub>/architecture.md` at each depth is
  sent to the model, once per session, hidden from your transcript.

## Configuration

`/rpiv-models` writes `~/.config/rpiv-pi/models.json` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rpiv-pi/…`
when that is set to an absolute path, or a `~` / `~/…` path, which is tilde-expanded
first), with mode `0600`. The file is optional — missing or malformed JSON degrades to
no overrides.

| Setting | What it does | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/rpiv-models` | Pick model + reasoning effort for the global default, a subagent, a skill, a workflow stage, or a preset stage | no overrides |
| `RPIV_LANES_HOTKEY` | Rebind the lane-browser hotkey to any Pi key id, or set `off` to register none | `ctrl+q` |
| `RPIV_BASH_TIMEOUT_MS` | Per-command bash watchdog inside detached child sessions, clamped to 5 s–30 min | `180000` (3 min) |

## Reference

- [docs/skills.md](./docs/skills.md) — all 29 skills: what each consumes, what it writes,
  and which ones the model may pick on its own.
- [docs/workflows.md](./docs/workflows.md) — the four `/wf` pipelines stage by stage,
  plus hand-driven recipes for when you don't want a whole pipeline.
- [docs/lanes.md](./docs/lanes.md) — the dock, the lane browser's full key map, parked
  questions, and the lane environment variables.
- [docs/models-config.md](./docs/models-config.md) — giving Pi a provider, then the
  complete `models.json` schema, cascade, and worked examples.
- [docs/agents.md](./docs/agents.md) — the 15 bundled subagents and how the on-disk sync
  decides what to overwrite.
- [docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md) — what gets registered, guidance and
  git-context injection, sibling coupling, and uninstall.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Why |
| --- | --- |
| [Pi Agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) | The host. Install it globally so `pi` is on your PATH |
| A model provider | Pi's own `/login` or `~/.pi/agent/models.json` — see [docs/models-config.md](./docs/models-config.md) |
| [`@tintinweb/pi-subagents`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tintinweb/pi-subagents) | Supplies the `Agent` tool. Without it the parallel-analysis skills cannot dispatch. Installed by `/rpiv-setup` |
| [`@juicesharp/rpiv-workflow`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@juicesharp/rpiv-workflow) | Supplies `/wf`. Without it the four built-in workflows do not register. Installed by `/rpiv-setup` |
| `git` *(optional)* | Branch, commit, and user context. If it fails, injection is skipped and nothing else changes |
| Node.js 22+ | Runtime for Pi and rpiv-pi's bundled scripts |

You need no build step and no native dependency.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Session-start banner: *N sibling extension(s) missing* | Sibling plugins not installed | Run `/rpiv-setup`, then restart Pi |
| Session-start banner: *bundled agents need attention* | A bundled agent changed upstream and your on-disk copy was edited | Run `/rpiv-update-agents` — it overwrites rpiv-managed files, and never touches agents you added yourself |
| `/rpiv-setup` or `/rpiv-models` says it requires interactive mode | Running headless | Install manually with `pi install npm:<pkg>`, or hand-edit `models.json` |
| `/rpiv-setup` fails on one package | Network or registry issue | Retry that package with `pi install npm:<pkg>`, then re-run `/rpiv-setup` |
| `/lanes` reports *No in-flight runs* (and `ctrl+q` does nothing) | Nothing is running | Expected — the browser only opens over live lanes |
| `ctrl+q` does nothing | `RPIV_LANES_HOTKEY` is set to `off`, empty, or an unrecognized key id | Unset it, or use `/lanes` |
| A stage stalls, then reports a per-command timeout | A bash command wedged past the watchdog | Raise `RPIV_BASH_TIMEOUT_MS` (max 1800000) before starting Pi |
| `/rpiv-models` reports *No models available* | Pi has no provider configured | Run `/login`, or add a provider to `~/.pi/agent/models.json` |
