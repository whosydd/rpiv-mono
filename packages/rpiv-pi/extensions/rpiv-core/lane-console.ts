/**
 * lane-console — the unified, focused lane BROWSER: ONE in-flow surface (it replaces the
 * editor via a non-overlay `ui.custom`, so the primary footer stays visible) that is the SOLE
 * stepped-in surface for every lane. Stepping in (↓ from an empty prompt, `^Q`, or
 * `/lanes`) opens it; it is not the belowEditor dock's active mode (the dock stays a
 * read-only ambient glance).
 *
 * Layout is the ambient dock's lane list, UNCHANGED, plus a live-output region on top —
 * so the lane view is static across the step-in. The bottom-pinned LANE BLOCK is rendered
 * by the SHARED renderer (lane-list.ts) with the SAME compact `laneCap` the dock uses, so a
 * row is byte-for-byte identical to the ambient one (the only delta is the `❯` cursor). The
 * browser spends its extra height (90% of the terminal) on the LIVE-OUTPUT region above the
 * lanes: a `── live output ──` labelled border, then the selected unit's transcript
 * unfurling upward, then any inline question. Arrows move the selection and the transcript
 * re-targets in place, so you see a lane's context the instant you land on it.
 *
 * When the selected unit has a queued `ask_user_question` (`peekInput` non-empty), the
 * questionnaire is mounted INLINE in the live-output region EAGERLY (so `this.inner` is built
 * and arming is instant — no async settle on the reveal) but NOT PAINTED until armed: the
 * render gate holds the band off in lane focus, so the surface is height-identical to
 * read-only and only the `⚑` needs-input badge + the `⏎ answer` footer cue that the selected
 * unit is answerable. Arming (`⏎`/`→`) flips to question focus — the band paints and the
 * questionnaire owns arrows/space/tab/text. On a lane (parent) row whose `⚑` aggregates a
 * fan-out unit's queue, `⏎` first JUMPS the selection to the flagged unit sub-row and arms
 * there (the parent row's own queue key is the single-unit slot, so nothing mounts on it) —
 * the flagged lane row never dead-ends. `esc` hands keys back to the lanes and RE-HIDES
 * the band (the question stays deferred, not cancelled). Answering commits the child and
 * advances the unit's FIFO in place; a same-unit follow-up stays armed, but a genuine drain
 * or cross-lane re-sort returns to lane focus with the band hidden (the browser stays open —
 * you are never stranded, the lanes + transcript are still there).
 *
 * The deferred question is a captured `{factory, options, resolve}` (run-lane-registry
 * PendingInput). We instantiate `head.factory` against a `cappedTui` whose `terminal.rows`
 * reports the question's ALLOCATED band, so the questionnaire self-windows via its own
 * 3-region scroller (build-questionnaire.ts:105 reads getTerminalRows) with NO change to
 * the ask-user-question package. The console is therefore generic over ANY deferred
 * overlay factory.
 *
 * Height is CONSTANT: every frame totals exactly `maxRows` (90% of the terminal) — the
 * transcript is the ONLY variable-height band (it absorbs the question mount/unmount and the
 * lane-count changes), so the lane block never moves (the static-lanes + ghost-block
 * invariant, the chain 56af2f9/cdcf3ee/c0797b6); a full repaint is forced on every mount /
 * commit / re-target / focus flip.
