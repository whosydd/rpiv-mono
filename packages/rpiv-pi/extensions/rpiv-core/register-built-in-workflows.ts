/**
 * Guarded registration of rpiv-pi's built-in workflows into the
 * `@juicesharp/rpiv-workflow` runtime registry.
 *
 * rpiv-workflow is a SIBLING (see siblings.ts) — a peerDependency that a clean
 * `npm install @juicesharp/rpiv-pi` does NOT pull in; users add it via
 * /rpiv-setup. So rpiv-core must never statically import it: a top-level
 * `import … from "@juicesharp/rpiv-workflow"` makes the WHOLE extension fail to
 * load when the sibling is absent, which in turn suppresses the very
 * /rpiv-setup command and missing-sibling banner that tell the user to install
 * it — a chicken-and-egg that strands clean installs.
 *
 * The dependency is therefore deferred behind a dynamic import so the entry
 * point has no static edge to the peer. When rpiv-workflow is absent we simply
 * skip registration: the built-ins are consumed only by the `/wf` command,
 * which lives in rpiv-workflow itself, so there is nothing to lose. This keeps
 * rpiv-core aligned with the "no runtime import of sibling packages" rule the
 * other siblings already follow (siblings.ts header).
