/**
 * question-lifecycle — a consumer-neutral pub/sub stream of workflow question
 * lifecycle events, sourced from run-lane-registry's pending-input queue.
 *
 * run-lane-registry is the PRODUCER: every mutation that parks or settles a
 * foreground-contract stage's deferred question emits here (AFTER its own
 * `notify()`). This module is the SIGNAL surface a consumer subscribes to — it
 * owns NO registry state and imports NO `ExtensionAPI`, so any extension can read
 * the question lifecycle without coupling to the lane model. The first consumer
 * is the Warp badge bridge (workflow-question-warp-bridge.ts), which translates
 * the aggregate 0→≥1 / ≥1→0 transitions into OSC badge events.
 *
 * Instance-independent channel: the listener Set is anchored on a process-global
 * `Symbol.for("@juicesharp/rpiv-pi:questionLifecycle")` slot — NOT module-level
 * state. A detached workflow child re-loads rpiv-core and may get a SEPARATE
 * module instance; a module-local Set would split producers and consumers across
 * instances. The global slot guarantees every instance shares ONE stream,
 * mirroring run-lane-registry's own slot discipline. Reset in place by
 * `__resetQuestionLifecycle()` in test/setup.ts beforeEach.
 *
 * Fail-soft `publish`: a throwing listener never blocks its siblings or the
 * registry mutation that triggered the emit — per-listener try/catch, mirroring
 * run-lane-registry's `notify()`.
