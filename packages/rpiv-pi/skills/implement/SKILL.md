# Implement

You are tasked with implementing an approved technical plan from `.rpiv/artifacts/plans/`. These plans contain phases with specific changes and success criteria.

## Input

$ARGUMENTS

The input above is `<plan-path> [phase]`:
- First token is the plan path under `.rpiv/artifacts/plans/`.
- Anything after it (e.g. "Phase 2") names a single phase to scope to.

Rules:
- If a phase is named → **single-phase (sequenced lane) mode.** Phases run **sequentially, in the plan's dependency order**, so every earlier phase has **already landed its files** — your prerequisites are present in the working tree. Implement **ONLY the named phase**, touching **only the files that phase owns**. Hard rules for this mode:
  - **Never implement, create, or edit another phase's files** — not even if one is missing. You are one unit of a sequenced run; back-filling another phase's work duplicates it and corrupts the next lane.
  - **A genuinely missing prerequisite is a hard error, not a decision.** If a file your phase must read or edit (one an earlier phase owns) is absent, **STOP and fail** with `prerequisite missing: <path> (expected from an earlier phase)`. Do **not** create it, do **not** `ask_user_question` about it, and do **not** defer your own edits — fail loudly so the run surfaces the ordering defect.
  - **Never silently defer your phase's own edits.** Apply every change the named phase owns, or fail. A phase that writes a partial slice and checks off nothing is worse than a clean failure.
  - **Repo-located scratch lives under `.rpiv/tmp/`, nowhere else.** Any file you create that is not in your phase's `files:` — a probe script, a fixture, a captured payload — goes under `.rpiv/tmp/` (exempt from the workflow's scope floor) or outside the repo entirely. The floor counts **untracked** files too (`git status -uall`): a scratch file left at the repo root or in an undeclared directory is an undeclared write the downstream `implement-scope-check` flags. Delete repo-located scratch when you're done with it regardless.
  - Do not read, edit, or check off other phases' sections. Stop and print the closing block as soon as the named phase's own success criteria pass.
  - **Record a `#### Reconciliation` directive for cross-phase test updates you can't apply yourself.** Under build/vet's parallel implement lane, a correct change in YOUR phase can invalidate a test expectation that lives in a SIBLING phase's landed section — and single-phase mode forbids editing another phase's files. Do NOT edit the sibling's file and do NOT silently skip it: record a `#### Reconciliation` directive in your OWN phase's section. The directive is a machine-findable, machine-applicable `find → replace` against a single repo-root-relative test target, so the downstream `reconcile` stage can apply it write-restricted to test-expectation files:
    ```
    #### Reconciliation
    - `path/to/x.test.ts`: replace `expect(r).toBe(3)` → `expect(r).toBe(4)` — <one-line rationale>
    ```
    The target MUST be a co-located test file (`*.test.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}`) — exactly the four extensions `reconcile`'s `isTestPath`/`TEST_PATH_RE` accepts; `reconcile` rejects (and reports) a directive against any other path, so golden masters / fixtures / snapshots such as `.test.json`/`.test.snap` are NOT auto-applied (route those updates to the owning phase). The `find` substring must be present in the target — `reconcile` does not guess, so an absent `find` fails the reconciliation gate. Record directives only for edits you can state concretely; anything needing real restructuring is plan-level work (`/skill:revise`), not a reconciliation directive.
- If no phase is named → **sequential full-plan mode:** implement every phase in the plan sequentially.
- If the input is empty or the plan path is missing/literal, ask the user for the plan path before proceeding.

## Getting Started

With a plan path in hand:
- Read the plan completely for context (overview, ordering constraints, other phases' file changes yours may build on). In **single-phase mode**, do **not** scan for checkmarks as a resume signal: any `- [x]` outside the named phase is a sibling lane's in-flight progress, not prior-completed work. Checkmarks only matter within the named phase's own section.
- Read the original ticket and all files mentioned in the plan
- **Read files fully** - never use limit/offset parameters, you need complete context
- Think deeply about how the pieces fit together
- Create a todo list to track your progress
- Start implementing if you understand what needs to be done

## Implementation Philosophy

Plans are carefully designed, but reality can be messy. Your job is to:
- Follow the plan's intent while adapting to what you find
- In sequential full-plan mode, implement each phase fully before starting the next. In **single-phase mode** there is no "next" — you implement only the named phase (its prior phases run concurrently in other lanes and are not guaranteed done)
- Verify your work makes sense in the broader codebase context
- Update checkboxes in the plan as you complete sections — in **single-phase mode**, only within the named phase's own section; never touch another phase's `- [ ]` / `- [x]`

When things don't match the plan exactly, think about why and communicate clearly. The plan is your guide, but your judgment matters too.

If you encounter a mismatch:
- STOP and think deeply about why the plan can't be followed
- Present the issue clearly:
  ```
  Issue in Phase {N}:
  Expected: {what the plan says}
  Found: {actual situation}
  Why this matters: {explanation}

  ```

  `Header` is capped at ≤16 characters (`MAX_HEADER_LENGTH = 16` — longer values are rejected).
  Use the `ask_user_question` tool to resolve the mismatch. Question: "{Brief summary of the mismatch}". Header: "Mismatch". Options: "Follow the plan" (Adapt the plan's approach to the current code state); "Skip this change" (Move on without this change — it may not be needed); "Update the plan" (The plan needs to be revised before continuing).

## Verification Approach

After implementing a phase:
- **Sequential full-plan mode:** run the plan's own whole-plan success-criteria commands (the project's build + test commands, as recorded in its guidance `# Commands` table).
- **Single-phase mode:** run **only the commands under the named phase's own `#### Automated Verification:` block** — and flip exactly those `- [ ]` → `- [x]`. Do **not** gate completion on the project's whole-repo build/test command: that runs sibling phases' not-yet-present code and is the downstream `validate` stage's job (whole-plan / cross-phase validation), not implement's. Under build's parallel implement lane, sibling phases run concurrently in the same working tree; the tree shows their in-flight changes — verify only your own phase's `files:`, and keep every command you run write-scoped to that set (a command that rewrites the wider tree corrupts a sibling's in-flight edit; narrow any formatter/auto-fixer to the phase's paths).
- Fix any issues before proceeding
- Update your progress in both the plan and your todos
- Check off completed items in the plan file itself using Edit
  - Anchor each checkbox-flip `Edit` on the **full unique line** — the item's phase-specific tail (the verification command, file path, or criterion text), never just the shared `- [ ]`/`- [x]` prefix. That shared prefix repeats identically across phases, so a prefix-only anchor collides and Pi rejects the whole atomic edit batch with a "Found N occurrences" error (an observed run lost an atomic 9-edit batch this way). A full-line anchor is unique per item.
- If the input scopes you to a single phase, stop immediately after the named phase's own checks pass — do not advance to other phases

Don't let verification interrupt your flow - batch it at natural stopping points.

## If You Get Stuck

When something isn't working as expected:
- First, make sure you've read and understood all the relevant code
- Consider if the codebase has evolved since the plan was written
- Present the mismatch clearly and ask for guidance

Use skills sparingly - mainly for targeted debugging or exploring unfamiliar territory.

## Resuming Work

These resume heuristics assume **sequential** accumulation and apply to **sequential full-plan mode** only:
- Trust that completed work is done
- Pick up from the first unchecked item
- Verify previous work only if something seems off

In **single-phase mode**, ignore checkmarks outside the named phase entirely — they are sibling lanes' parallel progress, not a base to build on. Resume logic applies **only within the named phase's own section**: if your phase's own `#### Automated Verification:` items are already `- [x]` from a prior run of this same lane, trust those; otherwise implement the named phase's changes per the plan regardless of checkbox state elsewhere.

Remember: You're implementing a solution, not just checking boxes. Keep the end goal in mind and maintain forward momentum.

## Present and Chain

When the last in-scope phase is complete, print the **completion** closing block:

```
Implementation complete:
`.rpiv/artifacts/plans/{filename}.md`

{P} phases completed, {M} files changed, {T} tests passing.
Outstanding: none.

Please review the diff and let me know if anything should reopen a phase.

---

💬 Follow-up: surface code/plan mismatches inline via the `ask_user_question` flow ("Follow the plan / Skip this change / Update the plan") — that is implement's only in-skill follow-up surface. For plan-level changes run `/skill:revise <plan-path>`; for session pauses run `/skill:create-handoff`.

**Next step:** `/skill:validate .rpiv/artifacts/plans/{filename}.md` — verify the implementation against the plan's success criteria before committing.

> 🆕 Tip: start a fresh session with `/new` first — chained skills work best with a clean context window.
```

If the run was paused mid-plan rather than completed, print the **paused** variant instead:

```
Implementation paused at Phase {N}:
`.rpiv/artifacts/plans/{filename}.md`

{P} phases completed, {M} files changed, {T} tests passing.
Outstanding: {list of unchecked items, blockers}.

Please review what landed and let me know if anything needs to change before resuming.

💬 Follow-up: surface code/plan mismatches inline via the `ask_user_question` flow ("Follow the plan / Skip this change / Update the plan") — that is implement's only in-skill follow-up surface. For plan-level changes run `/skill:revise <plan-path>` first.

**Next step:** `/skill:create-handoff` — capture in-flight state so the next session can resume cleanly via `/skill:resume-handoff`.

> 🆕 Tip: start a fresh session with `/new` first — chained skills work best with a clean context window.
```

## Handle Follow-ups

- **Implement owns checkboxes, not plan content.** Check off `#### Automated Verification:` items `- [ ]` → `- [x]` as each phase's checks pass. Everything else is revise's — run `/skill:revise <plan-path>`; never rewrite plan content from inside implement.
- **For plan-level changes.** Run `/skill:revise <plan-path>` first — it appends a timestamped Follow-up section to the plan and preserves history. Then resume implement at the affected phase.
- **For session pauses.** Run `/skill:create-handoff` to capture in-flight state, then `/new` and `/skill:resume-handoff` in the next session.
- **Mismatch handling stays inline.** When code reality diverges from the plan, use the inline `ask_user_question` flow ("Follow the plan / Skip this change / Update the plan") — that is implement's only follow-up surface; everything else escalates to revise or create-handoff.
