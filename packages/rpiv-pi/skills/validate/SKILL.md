# Validate

You are tasked with validating that an implementation plan was correctly executed, verifying all success criteria and identifying any deviations or issues.

## Input

User input (raw): `$ARGUMENTS`

Expected shape: an optional plan path (usually under `.rpiv/artifacts/plans/`), optionally followed by `--goal <path>` (the user's original brief, captured verbatim at run start), `--baseline <path>` (the run-start snapshot of paths that were ALREADY dirty before the run touched anything — a JSON file with a `paths` array), and/or `--scope <path>` (the workflow scope floor's verdict JSON — `{ verdict, findings: [{ detail, where }] }` — recording writes outside the plan's declared write-set for you to adjudicate). Peel the `--goal`, `--baseline`, and `--scope` flags first; what remains is the plan path. Only if the user input above is empty, or no plan path remains after peeling, branch on the recent-plans list in the Metadata block.

## Metadata

```!
node "${SKILL_DIR}/../_shared/now.mjs"
echo
node "${SKILL_DIR}/../_shared/git-context.mjs"
echo
echo "### recent (read only in case of empty user input)"
echo "recent plans:"
node "${SKILL_DIR}/../_shared/list-recent.mjs" .rpiv/artifacts/plans 10
```

## Steps

### Step 1: Input Handling and Context Discovery

When invoked:

1. **Determine context** — fresh or existing conversation?
   - If existing: review what was implemented in this session, then proceed to Step 2.
   - If fresh: continue with the substeps below.

2. **Locate the plan**:
   - If plan path provided, use it.
   - Otherwise, branch on the `recent plans:` listing in the Metadata block:
     - **Empty** — no plans under `.rpiv/artifacts/plans/`; ask the user for a path in prose.
     - **Exactly one entry** — confirm with `ask_user_question`: "Validate this plan?" with options "Validate `<filename>` (Recommended)" and "Pick a different path".
     - **Two or more entries** — present the top 4 filenames as `ask_user_question` options. The tool automatically appends a `Type something.` free-text row; do not list it manually.

3. **Read the implementation plan** completely

4. **Identify what should have changed**:
   - List all files that should be modified
   - Note all success criteria (automated and manual)
   - Identify key functionality to verify

5. **Gather implementation evidence**:

   **If `in_repo:` in the Metadata block is `no`:**
   - Skip git-based evidence gathering (git log, git diff).
   - Validate via file inspection, the plan's `#### Automated Verification:` commands, and the plan checklist.
   - Note in report: "Git history unavailable — validation based on file inspection only".

   Otherwise:
   - `git log --oneline -n 20` — recent commits for implementation context.
   - `git diff <base>..HEAD` — where `<base>` covers the implementation commits (determine from `git log` above). Scope to specific paths if the diff is large.
   - The plan's own `#### Automated Verification:` commands — read them out of the plan and run them as-written. Do NOT hardcode `make` or any project-specific build tool here; the plan encodes the right commands per project (e.g. `npm run check`, `npm test`, `cargo test`, `pytest`).

6. **Check pattern conformance and drift**:
   - For each new or substantially rewritten file, Read an established sibling (same directory or role) and compare shape: imports, naming, error handling, test structure. Record only genuine divergences.
   - Grep for drift the change leaves behind: renamed or removed terms still appearing in comments, docs, or test descriptions; documentation the change makes untrue.
   - Report convention notes under `#### Pattern Conformance:`; stale references and invalidated statements under `#### Deviations from Plan:` or `#### Potential Issues:` by severity.

### Step 2: Systematic Validation

For each phase in the plan:

1. **Check completion status**:
   - Look for checkmarks in the plan (- [x])
   - Verify the actual code matches claimed completion

2. **Run automated verification**:
   - Execute each command from "Automated Verification"
   - Document pass/fail status
   - If failures, investigate root cause

3. **Assess manual criteria**:
   - List what needs manual testing
   - Provide clear steps for user verification

4. **Think deeply about edge cases**:
   - Were error conditions handled?
   - Are there missing validations?
   - Could the implementation break existing functionality?

5. **Scope working-tree criteria to the run's own delta** (only when `--baseline` was provided):
   - Read the baseline file's `paths` array — these paths were dirty BEFORE the run started (recorded by the workflow at run start; the commit skill fences them off the same way).
   - Any criterion judging what the work touched ("only these files touched", "no unrelated changes", diff-scope checks) is evaluated against the working tree MINUS the baseline paths: subtract every baseline path from the dirty set before comparing to the plan's file list.
   - Baseline paths are pre-existing, out-of-scope dirt — report them under a short "Pre-existing working-tree changes (baseline)" note for visibility, but NEVER count them as a scope violation or let them force `verdict: fail`.
   - A missing or unreadable baseline file: fall back to judging the whole tree (today's behavior) and say so in the report.

6. **Attribute whole-plan command failures before they force the verdict.** When a whole-plan (not per-phase) command fails, attribute each failing finding to its file:
   - If **every** failing file is outside the run's own delta — in the `--baseline` paths, or byte-identical to the merge base, verified per file with `git diff --quiet <base> -- <file>` (when the implementation is uncommitted — the workflow's normal case, validate runs before commit — `<base>` is simply `HEAD`) — the failure is pre-existing debt: the criterion was authored against an assumed-clean repo and is unachievable as written. Report it under `#### Potential Issues:` as "pre-existing at base — criterion unachievable as written", rule the criterion **not met, non-blocking**, and record it under `#### Deviations from Plan:` as a *plan* deviation (the criterion, not the implementation, deviated). Do NOT let such a failure alone force `verdict: fail`.
   - The evidence bar is mandatory: no `git diff --quiet` proof for a failing file, no downgrade — the failure blocks as usual.
   - Any failing finding inside the run's delta keeps normal behavior: the command fails, the verdict fails.

7. **Adjudicate scope-floor findings** (only when `--scope` was provided):
   - Read the verdict JSON. If `verdict` is `"pass"` or `findings` is empty, there are no floor findings to rule — but the quarantine-manifest check in the last bullet below **still applies**: a post-quarantine re-check threads a clean `pass` verdict, and the manifest is then the only surviving record of what the run's quarantine arm moved.
   - Each finding names a write outside the plan's declared write-set that the deterministic floor could not classify. Rule each one: an out-of-scope tracked write you can **explain** — a lockfile or generated artifact a declared phase's own commands produce, churn already listed in the `--baseline` paths — is a non-blocking note under `#### Potential Issues:`, quoting the explanation. A write that is **demonstrably the run's own in-goal work** — it implements a named phase's stated change and that phase's verification covers it — is also explained: record it under `#### Deviations from Plan:` as a plan deviation (the owning phase's `files:` is incomplete), non-blocking. An out-of-scope write you **cannot explain forces `verdict: fail`** and is reported as a scope violation (a phase escaped its declared `files:` and may have overwritten sibling work — or the write is not the run's work at all).
   - **Quarantine manifest — check unconditionally, whatever the verdict says.** Glob `.rpiv/artifacts/verdicts/scope-quarantine__*.json`. If a manifest exists, rule on **every** `moved` entry (the record accumulates across fix-loop rounds): each names a run-created undeclared file moved — never deleted — from `from` to `to` under `.rpiv/tmp/scope-quarantine/`. A moved **scratch** file (probe script, fixture, captured payload) is a non-blocking note. A moved file the **deliverable needs** — anything a phase's change references or a criterion exercises — means its phase forgot to declare it in `files:`: report it under `#### Deviations from Plan:`, name the quarantine path it can be restored from, and rule **`verdict: fail`** (the working tree is missing the file). Treat `refused` entries (paths the arm declined to move) the same way.

8. **Check goal conformance** (only when `--goal` was provided):
   - Read the goal file fully — it is the user's brief in their own words.
   - Verify the delivered result honors every explicit ask and constraint in it. A goal requirement the plan never carried is still a gap — the plan, not just the implementation, can deviate from the user.
   - Report shortfalls under **Deviations from Plan**, quoting the goal's actual wording; never infer unstated scope from it.

9. **Rule every plan risk flag** (when the plan carries a `risks:` frontmatter array):
   - The plan's `risks:` array (each `{ id, claim }`, described under `## Risk Flags`) is the structured channel of decisions the planner asked to have checked. You are REQUIRED to rule on each one against the actual implementation — not skip it.
   - For each flag, verify its `claim` against the delivered code (Read/Grep the relevant `file:line`) and record a `risk_rulings: [{ id, pass }]` entry — `pass: true` when the risk is unfounded or handled, `pass: false` when it is real and unaddressed in the shipped code.
   - **For a `disposition: verify-at-implement` flag**, do not just Read/Grep — RUN its declared `procedure` (the named command/test the plan's `owner` phase promised) against the shipped code and rule `pass: false` if that procedure fails. This is the phase that discharges the deferral the plan-grade panel accepted on trust; a deferred risk whose procedure now fails is exactly the un-addressed-defect class this gate catches. A mechanics (`claim_type: mechanics`) flag is verified against its shipped `file:line` as above.
   - **Any `pass: false` ruling forces `verdict: fail`** and is reported under **Potential Issues**, quoting the flag's claim. A flagged risk that shipped unaddressed is exactly the class of defect this gate exists to catch.

### Step 3: Write the Validation Report

1. **Determine metadata** (from the Metadata block at the top of this skill):
   - Filename: `.rpiv/artifacts/validation/<slug>_<plan-topic-kebab>.md` — `<slug>` is the second tab-separated field on line 1 of the Metadata block above; `<plan-topic-kebab>` is the plan's `topic:` frontmatter value lowercased and hyphen-joined.
   - `repository:` ← `repo:` label; `branch:` / `commit:` ← matching labels.
   - `date:` ← `<iso>` (first tab-separated field on line 1 of the Metadata block above, offset verbatim).
   - `author:` ← matching label (fallback: `unknown`).
   - `parent:` ← the plan path resolved in Step 1.
   - `tags:` ← `[validation, ...]` plus any tags carried from the plan's frontmatter.
   - `topic:` ← `"Validation of <plan topic>"`.

2. **Determine verdict** (`status` is always `ready` — written once):
   - `verdict: pass` — every phase marked `- [x]` in the plan is verified against the code, every automated command passes (excluding whole-plan failures ruled pre-existing/non-blocking per Step 2.6), no Deviations from Plan and no Potential Issues require action, every plan `risks:` flag ruled `pass`, and every scope-floor finding and quarantine-manifest entry (Step 2.7) is explained.
   - `verdict: fail` — any phase fails verification, any automated command fails (excluding whole-plan failures ruled pre-existing/non-blocking per Step 2.6), any Deviations / Potential Issues list items that require action, **any plan risk flag ruled `pass: false`** (a flagged risk shipped unaddressed), or **any scope-floor finding or quarantined/refused file you could not rule benign** (Step 2.7).
   - When the plan carried a `risks:` array, add a `risk_rulings: [{ id, pass }]` field to the report frontmatter — one ruling per flag.

3. **Write the artifact** using the Write tool (no Edit — this skill writes once per run). Read `templates/validation.md`, fill every `{placeholder}` with the values determined above and the observations gathered in Step 2, apply the section-omission rules in the template (omit `#### Pattern Conformance:` and `#### Potential Issues:` entirely when empty; keep all other sections and emit `None — …` literals when empty), and Write the result to the target path.

**What is NOT emitted to the artifact**: raw command or `git log` output, intermediate reasoning. The Findings subsections capture verified outcomes only.

### Step 4: Present Summary

```
Validation written to:
`.rpiv/artifacts/validation/{filename}.md`

Verdict: {pass | fail}
```

Follow-up footer:

---

💬 Follow-up: if findings are localized, fix them and re-run `/skill:validate`. If findings imply plan-level changes, escalate to `/skill:revise <plan-path>` first.

**Next step:** `/skill:commit` — group the validated changes into atomic commits (skip if `verdict: fail` — fix the gaps first, then re-run `/skill:validate`).

> 🆕 Tip: start a fresh session with `/new` first — chained skills work best with a clean context window.

## Handle Follow-ups

- **Validate does not edit code or plans.** It produces a report. Fixes happen in implement; plan revisions happen in revise.
- **Localized gaps.** If findings are small and localized, fix them in-place and re-run `/skill:validate` for a fresh report.
- **Plan-level gaps.** If findings imply the plan itself is wrong (missing phases, wrong approach, untestable success criteria), escalate to `/skill:revise <plan-path>` first, then re-implement, then re-validate.
- **No append mode.** Each validation run produces a fresh report — there is no `## Follow-up` append. The previous block's `Next step:` stays valid only when `verdict: pass`.

## Working with Existing Context

If you were part of the implementation:
- Review the conversation history
- Check your todo list for what was completed
- Focus validation on work done in this session
- Be honest about any shortcuts or incomplete items

## Important Guidelines

1. **Be thorough but practical** - Focus on what matters
2. **Run all automated checks** - Don't skip verification commands
3. **Document everything** - Both successes and issues
4. **Think critically** - Question if the implementation truly solves the problem
5. **Consider maintenance** - Will this be maintainable long-term?
6. **Repo-located scratch lives under `.rpiv/tmp/`, nowhere else** - Any file you create while running a plan's commands or a risk ruling's `procedure` — a driver script, a fixture, a captured payload — goes under `.rpiv/tmp/` (exempt from the workflow's scope floor) or outside the repo entirely. The floor counts **untracked** files too (`git status -uall`): scratch left anywhere else is an undeclared write the next `implement-scope-check` flags. Delete repo-located scratch when its command is done regardless.

## Validation Checklist

Always verify:
- [ ] Goal conformance checked when `--goal` was provided
- [ ] Working-tree scope criteria judged against tree-minus-baseline when `--baseline` was provided
- [ ] Scope-floor findings adjudicated AND the quarantine manifest checked (unconditionally) when `--scope` was provided
- [ ] Whole-plan command failures attributed (run's delta vs. pre-existing at base) before forcing the verdict
- [ ] All phases marked complete are actually done
- [ ] Automated tests pass
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns
- [ ] No regressions introduced
- [ ] Error handling is robust
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] Manual test steps are clear

## Relationship to Other Skills

Recommended workflow:
1. `/skill:implement` - Execute the implementation
2. `/skill:validate` - Verify implementation correctness
3. `/skill:commit` - Create atomic commits for the validated changes

Validate runs against the working tree (staged or committed), so running it before commit avoids amend churn when fixing a `verdict: fail`.

Remember: Good validation catches issues before they reach production. Be constructive but thorough in identifying gaps or improvements.
