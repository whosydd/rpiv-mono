## Validation Report: {Plan topic}

### Implementation Status

- ✓ Phase 1: {name} — {Fully implemented | Partially implemented (see Findings) | Not implemented}
- ✓ Phase 2: {name} — {…}
- ⚠️ Phase 3: {name} — {Partial — see Findings}

### Automated Verification Results

- ✓ {1-line label}: `{command from plan}` — {brief outcome, e.g., "368 files, no errors"}
- ✓ {1-line label}: `{command from plan}` — {brief outcome}
- ✗ {1-line label}: `{command from plan}` — {failure summary}
- ✓ No regressions detected

### Code Review Findings

#### Matches Plan:

- {file:line — what matches plan specification}
- {…}

#### Deviations from Plan:

- {file:line — what diverged and why (improvement vs gap)}
- {or:} None. Implementation is a faithful realization of the plan.

#### Pattern Conformance:

_Optional subsection — include when the pattern-conformance check surfaced observations worth recording. Omit the whole `#### Pattern Conformance:` block when there is nothing to say._

- ✓ {Imports / test structure / naming / mock patterns / etc.} follow established codebase conventions
- Minor observation: {non-blocking variation worth flagging — explicitly tag as "acceptable variation, not a deviation"}

#### Potential Issues:

_Optional subsection — include when risks not covered by the plan surface (missing indexes, rollback gaps, perf concerns). Omit the whole `#### Potential Issues:` block when there are none._

- {file:line — risk not covered by the plan}

### Manual Testing Required:

{Bulleted checklist when manual criteria exist:}

1. {area}:
   - [ ] {verifiable step}
   - [ ] {verifiable step}

{Or, when the plan has no manual criteria:}

None — {one-line reason, e.g., "the plan explicitly requires no functional changes, only documentation and tests."}

### Recommendations:

- {Actionable bullet — e.g., "Address linting warnings before merge"}
- {…}
- {Or, when `verdict: pass`:} Ready to commit — implementation is complete and validated.
