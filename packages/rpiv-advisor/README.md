Let the model you're working with hand its whole conversation to a second, stronger model and get back a plan, a correction, or a stop signal — then keep going. `rpiv-advisor` adds the zero-parameter `advisor` tool and the `/advisor` picker to [Pi Agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono), so you can drive a session with a fast model and keep a stronger reviewer one call away.

## Install

```sh
pi install npm:@juicesharp/rpiv-advisor
```

Restart your Pi session.

## Quick start

Nothing happens until you pick a reviewer. Run:

```
/advisor
```

You get a picker over every model Pi already has credentials for — start typing
to filter it by model name, provider, or `provider/id`. Pick one, and if it
supports reasoning you get a second picker for its effort level (`high` is
recommended). Pi confirms with `Advisor: <model>, <effort>`, and the `advisor`
tool goes live for this and every future session.

If the model you want isn't in the list, its provider isn't authenticated yet —
run Pi's `/login` for that provider, then re-run `/advisor`.

![The /advisor picker: a bordered panel titled "Advisor Tool" above a scrollable list of the models Pi has credentials for, with the current selection highlighted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juicesharp/rpiv-mono/main/packages/rpiv-advisor/docs/advisor.jpg)

From there the executor model calls `advisor()` on its own when it needs stronger
judgment. To turn it back off, run `/advisor` and choose **No advisor**.

## What you get

- **A second opinion without leaving the session** — the executor calls
  `advisor()` mid-turn, reads the reviewer's answer as the tool result, and
  resumes. Nothing is injected into your transcript, and the default prompt
  guidelines tell the executor to restate the advisor's key guidance in its
  next visible reply, so you are not left with only a collapsed tool card.
- **Nothing to type or paste** — the tool takes zero parameters. The whole
  conversation branch is serialised and forwarded automatically: the task, every
  tool call made, every result seen. That whole branch is billed against the
  reviewer model on every call, so escalations are not free.
- **The reviewer sees what survived compaction** — the branch is built from Pi's
  resolved LLM context, so compaction and branch summaries are forwarded instead
  of a stale raw replay.
- **Any model can be the reviewer** — every model you're authenticated for is in
  the `/advisor` picker, found by fuzzy-typing. No provider is privileged.
- **Pick once, it stays picked** — model and effort persist to `advisor.json`
  and are re-applied at every session start.
- **Skip it when you're already on a strong model** — list executor models in
  `disabledForModels` to strip the tool for them, optionally only at or above a
  reasoning-effort threshold. It strips and re-adds live as you switch model or
  effort mid-session.
- **Off costs nothing** — with no model selected the tool is stripped from the
  active set, so its prompt text never enters the system prompt at all.

## Configuration

Settings live in `~/.config/rpiv-advisor/advisor.json` (or
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rpiv-advisor/advisor.json` when that variable is set to an
absolute path). `/advisor` creates the file and chmods it to `0600`; a failed
write leaves your previous selection untouched and tells you so.

| Key | What it does | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `modelKey` | The reviewer model, as `"provider/modelId"`. Written by `/advisor`. | absent — advisor off |
| `effort` | Reasoning effort for the reviewer: `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`. Written by `/advisor`; only levels supported by the selected model are offered. | absent — no reasoning sent |
| `disabledForModels` | Executor models the advisor is stripped for. Plain strings block at any effort; `{ "model": "…", "minEffort": "…" }` blocks only at or above that effort. | `[]` |

```json
{
  "modelKey": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5",
  "effort": "high",
  "disabledForModels": [
    "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5",
    { "model": "openai/gpt-5.2", "minEffort": "high" }
  ]
}
```

`/advisor` only rewrites `modelKey` and `effort`, so hand-edited keys —
`disabledForModels` and the `guidance` overrides — survive every save.

## Reference

- [Configuration](https://github.com/juicesharp/rpiv-mono/blob/main/packages/rpiv-advisor/docs/configuration.md) — config file resolution, every key, blocklist matching rules, guidance overrides, and the full notification catalogue.
- [`advisor` tool reference](https://github.com/juicesharp/rpiv-mono/blob/main/packages/rpiv-advisor/docs/tool-reference.md) — schema, result envelope, failure paths, what gets sent to the reviewer, lifecycle hooks, and picker keys.

## Requirements

- A [Pi Agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) host — the extension loads
  through Pi's extension manifest. No native dependencies.
- An authenticated provider for the **reviewer** model, resolved through Pi's
  model registry.
- An interactive terminal for `/advisor`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The `/advisor` picker offers only **No advisor** | No provider is authenticated in Pi | Run Pi's `/login` for a provider, then re-run `/advisor` |
| `Advisor (<model>) has no API key available.` comes back as the tool result | Credentials for the reviewer's provider no longer resolve | Re-authenticate that provider with `/login` |
| `/advisor requires interactive mode` | Running under `pi --print …` or RPC | Run Pi interactively |
